# Elevator

Your mission should you choose to accept it, is to design a system that controls the elevator in a building with 7 storeys (indexed 0-6). 

A visual interface (UI) is optional but it's recommended. 

Focus on working with functions and objects first.

Below youâ€™ll find the requirements for the application 
and a breakdown of the fields to be used.

You shall deliver the code for this application and picture/s for the diagrams that illustrate your understanding of the application logic.

### Details

DONE = There are 7 floors in a block and only 2 lifts. 

DONE = Initially Lift A is at the ground floor and Lift B at the top floor. 

DONE = Whenever someone calls the lift from N th floor, the lift closest to that floor comes to pick him up. 

DONE = If both the lifts are at equidistant from the N th floor, then the lift from the lower floor comes up.

DONE = There are navigation buttons in each floor (up / down).

DONE = Inside the elevator there are buttons to select the destination.

DONE = Seven segment displays indicate the position of the lift. These are present inside the elevator.

DONE = There are arrows to indicate the direction of movement of the elevator in each floor. 

The following changes cause state transitions:
DONE = * 1.The elevator is called from one of the floors.
DONE = * 2.The destination has been reached.
DONE = * 3.The destination has been selected.

***For simplicity, only one destination can be selected.

### Functionality needed:

DONE = For each elevator, display its current state.

DONE = For each floor, display which elevator is going up/down

### Requirements

You have **4 day** from the moment you receive the problem to ask any relevant question about the specifications.
You have **5 days** to submit your code that implements the above mentioned functionalities.
The code should be added to a **public git repository**, we strongly recomment github for this.

 **We will take into consideration your thinking, logic, coding style and your code organization and structure as well as the correctness of the provided solution.**
